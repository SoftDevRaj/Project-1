# TechTalkz

## Project 1 for Columbia Engineering Boot Camp 
TechTalkz TM is a "platform that teaches you how to talk like a true techie." It is essentially a cultural-commentary game reflecting on the nature of AI and reality, ultimately making light of the fact that communication is irrevocably altered in the era of AI. TechTalkz is a platform for liberal-arts enthusiasts to generate language to sound "smart" and like they know what they're doing in front of their techy friends. If anyone answers yes to the question "have you ever been the only liberal arts person in a STEM-filled room?" they can benefit from TechTalkz. TechTalkz has a generator that links to a Techy AI that allows the user to save their favorite ridiculous "science-y" phrases to local storage. Then, the user unexpectedly talks to a computer, questioning reality, and ends on a Chuck Norris generator to make light of a potentially uncomfortable topic.

*In the monologue about existential dread, the writing goes from the coder's language organically into Chat GPT's answer to "write a monologue about existentialism."*

# User Stories
As a liberal arts person/someone who is not super well versed in tech (or comfortable in tech), I want an application that provides me with language via which to sound like I know what I’m saying in the tech sphere so that I can sound smart and not have imposters’ syndrome at parties or around my tech friends.

As a liberal arts person/someone who is not well-versed in tech who is having a technology-driven existential crisis, I want a Chuck Norris joke to motivate me to help me believe in humanity again so that I can feel good about the world.

# Acceptance Criteria
When I am asked if I want to sound smarter to my science friends,
then I am presented with a TechTalkz generator button that allows me to generate pseudo-scientific phrases,
then I can save my phrases to local storage and my computer automatically calculates how many times I've "been smart today."

When I am presented with an existential crisis by a computer,
then I have access to a Chuck Norris generator button so I can feel better about the world.
